Online news portal, RR News Express, is looking to expand its subscribers. To this end, they are introducing a new feature to the portal -**a new landing page**. The company wishes to know if this new landing page is more effective at attracting new subscribers. An A/B test has been carried out on 100 users. The users were divided equally into a control group, which viewed the old landing page, and an experimental group, which viewed the new landing page.
